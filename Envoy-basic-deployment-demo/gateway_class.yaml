# 🏭 GATEWAYCLASS = FACTORY BLUEPRINT
# 
# Think of it like:
# - Car manufacturer (Toyota, BMW, Tesla)
# - Phone brand (iPhone, Samsung, Google Pixel)
# - Gateway provider (Envoy, Istio, NGINX)
#
# GatewayClass says: "When you want a gateway, WHO should build it?"
# Here we're saying: "Envoy Gateway company will build our gateways"
#
# Real-world example:
# You want a car → You choose manufacturer (Toyota) → They build your specific car
# You want a gateway → You choose provider (Envoy) → They build your specific gateway
